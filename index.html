  <h2>What to Eat?</h2>
  <P> Like all people, you probably need food to live, and unfortunately food costs money. So what to do?
    Well obviously the only answer is to eat nothing but ramen noodles for three square meals a day. With
    the average cost of ramen noodles being about 13 cents per package, a person could eat 3 square meals
    a day for 365 days a year for only $142.65. To put that into perspective, the average American spends
    $3,672 a year on food, meaning that you are gonna be saving a ton of money! Just look at this chart
    showing how much happier you will be.

  <h4>How to become a Billionaire</h4>
  <P>Now I know what youre probably thinking at this point, "But Ryan,
    I dont have $142.65." No need to fear, I have a quick tip that will
    make all of your money problems go away. Just rob a bank, theyve got
    plenty of money, and its not like theyre gonna be needing it anytime
    soon, plus youve got lots of ramen to buy! So now all you need is a
    couple of ski masks, some friends with guns, and a getaway car that
    can go really fast. Also youll need to find a bank with minimum security
    , and youre probably gonna need to get rid of your fingerprints too. Hmm
    that seems like a lot of work, mabye just give blood or something, I heard
    they pay good money for that. Heres a link to a local place that offers
    cash for blood.
